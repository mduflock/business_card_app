    <string name="quals_paragraph">I\'m a rising junior at Georgetown University majoring in
        computer science and history with a minor in psychology. I spent my last summer balancing
        a customer service job with five computer science courses, building Android applications, and
        designing my own website. I\'ve tested multiple apps for Google and have extensive experience
        with public speaking, research, and teamwork as a member of the debate team. I\'m looking
        for software engineering internships, particularly at start-ups and non-profits.</string>
